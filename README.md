This is a somewhat simple bot with unfinished complex features for using with the Discord chat client.
I've redacted some inappropriate content I can't share as well as the password and username the bot uses.

I worked on this in my freetime outside of classes in late 2015 but may update in the future.

It uses node.js and the discord.js library, however, it may be outdated as the API has likely changed since then.
